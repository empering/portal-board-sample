Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

//include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a note will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

//include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

responses. Responses are in https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext
